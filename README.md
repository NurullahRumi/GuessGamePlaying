## GuessGamePlaying
### Description
* Sink all of the computer's Startups in the fewest number of guesses. you're given a rating level based on how well you perform. We haven't build GUI. so this version works at the command line. The computer will promt you to enter a guess (a cell), which you'll type at the command line (A-G && 0-6  like A0, A6, G0, G6, B3, C6, D4 etc). In responce to your guess, you'll see a result at the command-line, either "hit","miss","You sunk poniez"(or whatever the lucky Styartup of the day is). When you've sent all three Startups to that big 404 in the sky, the game ends by printing out your rating.
